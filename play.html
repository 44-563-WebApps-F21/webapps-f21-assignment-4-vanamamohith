            ACT II</p>


<p>                                  SCENE</p>

<p>_A state room in the <b class="c1">Ducal Palace_</b>, _hung with tapestries representing
the Masque of Venus_; _a large door in the centre opens into a corridor
of <b class="c2">red marble_</b>, _through which one can see a view of Padua_; _a large
canopy is set_ (_R.C._) _with three thrones_, _one a little lower than
the others_; _the ceiling is made of <b class="c3">long gilded beams_</b>; _furniture of
the period_, _chairs covered with <b class="c7">gilt leather_</b>, _and buffets set with
<b class="c4">gold</b> and <b class="c5">silver plate_</b>, _and chests painted with <b class="c6">mythological scenes_</b>.
_A number of the courtiers is out on the corridor looking from it down
into the street below_; _from the street comes the roar of a mob and
cries of_ ‘_Death to the Duke_’: _after a little interval enter the Duke
very calmly_; _he is leaning on the arm of Guido Ferranti_; _with him
enters also the Lord Cardinal_; _the mob still shouting_.
</p>


<h6 class="moh">DUKE</h6>

<p class="m1">No, my Lord Cardinal, I weary of her!
   Why, she is worse than ugly, she is good.</p>

<h6 class="moh">MAFFIO [_excitedly_]</h6>

<p class="m1">Your Grace, there are two thousand people there
   Who every moment grow more clamorous.</p>

<h6 class="moh">DUKE</h6>

<p class="m1">Tut, man, they waste their <b class="c3">strength</b> upon their lungs!
   People who shout so loud, my lords, <b class="c2">do nothing</b>;
   The only men I fear are <b class="c1">silent men</b>.</p>

   <p class="m2">                                                   [_A yell from the people_.]</p>

   <p class="m1">You see, Lord Cardinal, how my people love me.</p>

   <p class="m2">                                                      [_Another yell_.]</p>

   <p class="m1">Go, Petrucci,
   And tell the captain of the guard below
   To clear the square.  Do you not hear me, sir?
   Do what I bid you.</p>

   <p class="m2">                                                     [_Exit_ PETRUCCI.]</p>

<h6 class="moh">CARDINAL</h6>

<p class="m1">I beseech your Grace
   To <b class="c1">listen</b> to their <b class="c2">grievances</b>.</p>

<h6 class="moh">DUKE [_sitting on his throne_]</h6>

<p class="m1">Ay! the peaches
   Are not so big this year as they were last.
   I crave your pardon, <b class="c1">my lord Cardinal</b>,
   I thought you <b class="c2">spake of peaches.</b></p>

  <p class="m2">                                            [_A cheer from the people_.]</p>

   <p class="m1">What is that?</p>

<h6 class="moh">GUIDO [_rushes to the window_]</h6>

<p class="m1">The Duchess has gone forth into the square,
   And stands between the <b class="c1">people</b> and the <b class="c2">guard</b>,
   And will not let them shoot.</p>

<h6 class="moh">DUKE</h6>

<p>The devil take her!</p>

<h6 class="moh">GUIDO [_still at the window_]</h6>

<p class="m1">And followed by a dozen of the citizens
   Has come into the Palace.</p>

<h6 class="moh">DUKE [_starting up_]</h6>

<p class="m1"> By Saint James,
   Our Duchess waxes bold!</p>

  <p>                            END OF ACT II.</p>

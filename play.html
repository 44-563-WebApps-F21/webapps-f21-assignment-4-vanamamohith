            ACT II</p>


<p>                                  SCENE</p>

<p>_A state room in the Ducal Palace_, _hung with tapestries representing
the Masque of Venus_; _a large door in the centre opens into a corridor
of red marble_, _through which one can see a view of Padua_; _a large
canopy is set_ (_R.C._) _with three thrones_, _one a little lower than
the others_; _the ceiling is made of long gilded beams_; _furniture of
the period_, _chairs covered with gilt leather_, _and buffets set with
gold and silver plate_, _and chests painted with mythological scenes_.
_A number of the courtiers is out on the corridor looking from it down
into the street below_; _from the street comes the roar of a mob and
cries of_ ‘_Death to the Duke_’: _after a little interval enter the Duke
very calmly_; _he is leaning on the arm of Guido Ferranti_; _with him
enters also the Lord Cardinal_; _the mob still shouting_.
</p>


<h6>DUKE</h6>

<p>No, my Lord Cardinal, I weary of her!
   Why, she is worse than ugly, she is good.</p>

<h6>MAFFIO [_excitedly_]</h6>

<p>Your Grace, there are two thousand people there
   Who every moment grow more clamorous.</p>

<h6>DUKE</h6>

<p>Tut, man, they waste their strength upon their lungs!
   People who shout so loud, my lords, do nothing;
   The only men I fear are silent men.</p>

   <p>                                                   [_A yell from the people_.]</p>

   <p>You see, Lord Cardinal, how my people love me.</p>

   <p>                                                      [_Another yell_.]</p>

   <p>Go, Petrucci,
   And tell the captain of the guard below
   To clear the square.  Do you not hear me, sir?
   Do what I bid you.</p>

   <p>                                                     [_Exit_ PETRUCCI.]</p>

<h6>CARDINAL</h6>

<p>I beseech your Grace
   To listen to their grievances.</p>

<h6>DUKE [_sitting on his throne_]</h6>

<p>Ay! the peaches
   Are not so big this year as they were last.
   I crave your pardon, my lord Cardinal,
   I thought you spake of peaches.</p>

  <p>                                            [_A cheer from the people_.]</p>

   <p>What is that?</p>

<h6>GUIDO [_rushes to the window_]</h6>

<p>The Duchess has gone forth into the square,
   And stands between the people and the guard,
   And will not let them shoot.</p>

<h6>DUKE</h6>

<p>The devil take her!</p>

<h6>GUIDO [_still at the window_]</h6>

<p>And followed by a dozen of the citizens
   Has come into the Palace.</p>

<h6>DUKE [_starting up_]</h6>

<p> By Saint James,
   Our Duchess waxes bold!</p>

  <p>                            END OF ACT II.</p>
